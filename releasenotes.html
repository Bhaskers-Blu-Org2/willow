<h3>Visual Studio "15" Preview 1 (15.0.0-160402.1)</h3>
    <h4>Bugs Fixed:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>On some computers with Visual Studio 2013, 2015 and the "15" Preview, Visual Studio 2015 will experience package load failures, blocking users from using the product. (See the Visual Studio "15" Preview <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/05e0e20e-7ace-41fe-b0bc-3becc37ae618">known issues list</a> under "installation".) This change will fix computers that installed Visual Studio "15" Preview using the "new installer". </li>
</ul>
<h3>Installer (0.1.0-20160329.1) &amp; Visual Studio "15" Preview (15.0.0-160329)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Initial public build.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<p>This Visual Studio "15" Preview 3 experience has generally the same known issues as those documented on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/05e0e20e-7ace-41fe-b0bc-3becc37ae618">msdn.microsoft.com</a>. Additional known issues and limitations are listed below:</p>

<h3>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#general" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you are a Windows Insider, you may receive an erroneous warning from Windows SmartScreen that the file is unsigned. This is due to a change in the Authenticode signing requirements for Windows executables. You should be able to right-click on the file, choose Properties and verify for yourself that the file is SHA-1 and SHA-256 dual signed from a trusted Microsoft root certificate chain. This will be fixed in a future release.</li>
<li>If you are upgrading from Preview 2, you will be prompted to upgrade the installer itself. After upgrading the client, there is an intermittent error in some situations where the Upgrade button does not work. To resolve this issue, close the Visual Studio Installer application and reopen it, at which point the Upgrade button should be functional.</li>
<li>Many common project types, including ASP.NET Core and Universal Windows Platform are not supported in the current preview release, but will be added in a later release.</li>
<li>Install on-disk sizes reported may be somewhat inaccurate.</li>
<li>The new setup engine does not yet register file associations for project and solution types that it handles, so opening from File Explorer will not instantiate Visual Studio “15” Preview at this time. This will be fixed in a future build.</li>
<li>Uninstall fully removes Visual Studio, but some external dependencies (e.g. .NET Framework SDK) may still be present on your machine. You can manually remove these from Add/Remove Programs if they are not being used by other Visual Studio releases you may have on your machine.</li>
<li>On operating systems other than Windows 10 64-bit, when installing the C++ workload, you should reboot your computer before using Visual Studio. We'll be adding proper reboot handling in an upcoming release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="editor" class="anchor" href="#editor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Visual Studio Editor</h3>

<ul>
<li>Source file colorization may not work correctly when debugging code loaded from a source control server.</li>
<li>When you install just the Visual Studio core editor component, Team Explorer commands that require Office integration (send mail and open in Excel) will be inoperable. These features work if you have any other component installed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="net-desktop-development" class="anchor" href="#net-desktop-development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>.NET Desktop Development</h3>

<ul>
<li>Opening class diagrams does not work</li>
<li>Code Analysis does not work</li>
<li>Data Tooling (Server Explorer) does not work</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="c" class="anchor" href="#c" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C++</h3>

<ul>
<li>The lightweight installer does not currently support ATL or MFC.</li>
<li>The C++ component will not work correctly in a side-by-side installation with an Visual Studio “15” Preview install from the classic installer. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release.</li>
<li>The Edit-and-Continue debugging functionality causes Visual Studio to crash. This is a known issue, and will be fixed in the next release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="python" class="anchor" href="#python" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Python</h3>
